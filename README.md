### Face Recognition

This project aims to not only detect and localise a face, but also recognise it based on data fed to it before.

1. Run face_data_add.py which creates face_data.npy file. Press "c" once you see your faces' image in the 'My face' window. Do this for a number of times for each face. Then, enter the name of the person.

2. Now run face_recog.py to detect and recognises faces.
